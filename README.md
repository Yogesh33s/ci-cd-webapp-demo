# CI/CD Web Application Demo

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of a static website to GitHub Pages.

## Live Site

https://yogesh33s.github.io/ci-cd-webapp-demo/

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – A basic HTML file for demonstration.
- `.github/workflows/static.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow file for automatic deployment.

## How It Works

1. When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions is triggered.
2. The workflow defined in `static.yml` runs and deploys the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages.
3. The website becomes live at the GitHub Pages URL.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages
- HTML

## Status

The pipeline is successfully set up and working. The website is automatically deployed on every push to the main branch.
